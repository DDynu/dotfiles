# Hello to my dotfiles!
## Installation
You can install these manually or just use my setup script in the repo. Requires root access to install dependencies for pyenv
Everything in this script will be installed at local user.
> [!CAUTION]
> .bashrc file will be removed, make sure to back it up! Or if it's a symbolic link, then it's fine
## What is in this repo?
My setup for bash, neovim, tmux, starship configs, hyprland, synth shell and waybar, you can replicate my setup in a few minutes!
Thanks for stopping by!
